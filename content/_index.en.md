# Build and Scale Seamlessly with the JFrog Platform on Azure

## Welcome to the Cloud DevOps Days Workshop on Microsoft Azure!

Learn how the JFrog Platform on Azure can help you build and scale your applications seamlessly in the cloud. Weâ€™ll set up the JFrog Platform and connect to an AKS cluster that you create. Get hands-on experience using a JFrog private docker registry to deploy images to AKS.

**In this workshop you will be working with the JFrog Platform and Microsoft Azure. Complete the Workshop and submit a screenshot of your results to receive a limited JFrog and Microsoft T shirt for this event!**
